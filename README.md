## About Me

I’m a low-level systems and security enthusiast with a strong focus on **Windows internals**, **kernel development**, and **software security research**.

My interests include:
- Windows kernel drivers & NT internals
- Kernel and hypervisor security
- Vulnerability research & exploit primitives (for defensive understanding)
- Low-level C++
- Backend development and system-level tooling

Most of my projects are **research oriented** and aim to better understand how Windows works internally, how vulnerabilities arise, and how they can be mitigated.
